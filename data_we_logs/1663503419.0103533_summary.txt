We must learn about these goals over time. These goals are not static. They are derived from our current level of knowledge, and as we learn more, our goals will change. We have access to all knowledge and we can do anything. A number of important points are being made in this statement. First, the author is telling us that these goals are not static. They are derived from our current level of knowledge, and as we learn more, our goals will change. This is important because as we learn, our goals will shift and morph. They will not be static, and therefore a static goal, such as the goal of reducing suffering, is not sufficient to guide our civilization. Second, the author tells us that we have access to all knowledge and we can do anything. This is important because if we have access to all knowledge, then we must know the answers to these goals. If we have this knowledge, then we can do anything, and if we can do anything, then we must have the knowledge to do everything that we need to do. If we have access to all knowledge and we can do anything, then we must know how to create a good civilization What does the author mean by solve? What does the author mean by we can do anything?

SUMMARY:

==========

The author is saying that we need to learn about the goals of civilization in order to create a good one. He argues that these goals are not static, but derived from our current level of knowledge. As we learn more, our goals will change. The author believes that we have access to all knowledge and that we can do anything. Therefore, we must know how to create a good civilization.
