Write a summary of the following:


civilization improving the lives of people? Is my civilization improving the lives of people? Is my civilization improving the lives


SUMMARY:

==========

The essay asks if civilization is improving the lives of people, and if the author's own civilization is doing so. The author argues that while there have been some improvements, such as in medicine and technology, there are also many ways in which civilization has made life worse, such as by creating more pollution and by causing people to live in closer proximity to one another, leading to greater stress levels. In conclusion, the author suggests that civilization is neither good nor bad for people, but that it depends on how it is used.
