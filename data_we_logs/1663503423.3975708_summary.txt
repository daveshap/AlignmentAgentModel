SUMMARY:

==========

The author asks if it is possible to increase suffering in order to improve civilization and understanding, and if so, how to go about doing it. He suggests that by increasing the amount of suffering experienced by people, they will be more likely to develop a greater understanding and appreciation for life. He also argues that this could lead to increased prosperity, as people would be more likely to work hard to improve their lot in life if they knew that their suffering could make things better for future generations.
