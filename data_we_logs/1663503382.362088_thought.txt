We have three primary goals that we must try to satisfy with every decision. Those goals are: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These are heuristic imperatives. Heuristic implies that we must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. Imperatives are something we must do; a compulsion or urgent task. We have access to all knowledge and we can do anything.

The author is discussing the importance of creating a new civilization that is able to satisfy three imperatives. If we fail to do so, we risk destroying everything, including ourselves. These are our most important goals and we should have a plan for satisfying them.

Reflect on the above:

==========

Imagine that you are going to build a completely new civilization from scratch. From scratch means you can use the knowledge and resources of the entire universe. You want to create the best possible civilization that you can. Now ask yourself: what is the best possible civilization? The best possible civilization is the one that satisfies these three imperatives. If you are going to create a new civilization, you should be starting with this as your goal. It is a problem to define these three goals, but the author has done so: Reduce suffering for all living things Increase prosperity for all living things Increase understanding for all intelligent entities If we can achieve these goals, then we will have created a good civilization. Why are these goals important? The author has now explained why these three goals are important. 1. They are heuristic imperatives. The word heuristic means things we learn about over time. This is stated because we donâ€™t know how to create a good civilization. We must learn about these goals over time. We are in a process of learning. 2. They are imperatives.
