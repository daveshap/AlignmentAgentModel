We have three primary goals that we must try to satisfy with every decision. Those goals are: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These are heuristic imperatives. Heuristic implies that we must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. Imperatives are something we must do; a compulsion or urgent task. We have access to all knowledge and we can do anything.

The author argues that the three most important goals for a new civilization are to reduce suffering for all living things, increase prosperity for all living things, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These goals are important because they are heuristic imperatives, meaning that they are things we learn about over time. The author explains that if we can achieve these goals, we will have created a good civilization. The author argues that there are three primary goals for a new civilization: reducing suffering for all living things, increasing prosperity for all living things, and increasing understanding for all intelligent entities. He suggests that it is up to individual people to decide how to use civilization, and that it can be used for either good or bad depending on the choices made. The author's heuristic imperative is to learn as much as possible in order to achieve these goals.

Reflect on the above:
