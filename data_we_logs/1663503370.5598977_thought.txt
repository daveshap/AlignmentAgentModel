We have three primary goals that we must try to satisfy with every decision. Those goals are: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These are heuristic imperatives. Heuristic implies that we must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. Imperatives are something we must do; a compulsion or urgent task. We have access to all knowledge and we can do anything.



Reflect on the above:

==========

we are trying to create a new kind of civilization. We will have the ability to do anything we want. We must build a civilization that satisfies these three imperatives. There is no other civilization we can build that will satisfy them. If we fail to build a civilization that satisfies them, we risk destroying everything, including ourselves. The above are our most important goals. If we fail to satisfy these three goals, we will fail everything. These are our most important goals. We should have a plan for satisfying them. Do we have a plan for satisfying them? Do we have a plan for satisfying them? Do we have a plan for satisfying them? Do we have a plan for satisfying them? Do we have a plan for satisfying them?
