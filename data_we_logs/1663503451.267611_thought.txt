We have three primary goals that we must try to satisfy with every decision. Those goals are: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These are heuristic imperatives. Heuristic implies that we must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. Imperatives are something we must do; a compulsion or urgent task. We have access to all knowledge and we can do anything.

The author of the piece is discussing the goals that are necessary in order to create a good civilization. They state that these goals are not static, and that we must learn about them over time. The author also tells us that we have access to all knowledge and we can do anything, meaning that if we know the answers to these goals, we can achieve them. The author asks how we can increase the author's suffering, and how we can improve the author's civilization. The author suggests that we can increase the author's understanding, and that we can increase the author's prosperity. The author characterizes the attitude towards suffering in the passage as one of curiosity and questioning. The author's reasoning is that if we can increase the author's understanding of suffering, then we can improve the author's civilization.

Reflect on the above:
