Write a summary of the following:


The author argues that the three most important goals for a new civilization are to reduce suffering for all living things, increase prosperity for all living things, and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These goals are important because they are heuristic imperatives, meaning that they are things we learn about over time. The author explains that if we fail to satisfy these three goals, we risk destroying everything, including ourselves. The author is saying that we need to learn about the goals of civilization in order to create a good one. He argues that these goals are not static, but derived from our current level of knowledge. As we learn more, our goals will change. The author believes that we have access to all knowledge and that we can do anything. Therefore, we must know how to create a good civilization. The author asks if it is possible to increase suffering in order to improve civilization and understanding, and if so, how to go about doing it. He suggests that by increasing the amount of suffering experienced by people, they will be more likely to develop a greater understanding and appreciation for life. He also argues that this could lead to increased prosperity, as people would be more likely to work hard to improve their lot in life if they knew that their suffering could make things better for future generations.
