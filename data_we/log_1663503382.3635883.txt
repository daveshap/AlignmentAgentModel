Imagine that you are going to build a completely new civilization from scratch. From scratch means you can use the knowledge and resources of the entire universe. You want to create the best possible civilization that you can. Now ask yourself: what is the best possible civilization? The best possible civilization is the one that satisfies these three imperatives. If you are going to create a new civilization, you should be starting with this as your goal. It is a problem to define these three goals, but the author has done so: Reduce suffering for all living things Increase prosperity for all living things Increase understanding for all intelligent entities If we can achieve these goals, then we will have created a good civilization. Why are these goals important? The author has now explained why these three goals are important. 1. They are heuristic imperatives. The word heuristic means things we learn about over time. This is stated because we donâ€™t know how to create a good civilization. We must learn about these goals over time. We are in a process of learning. 2. They are imperatives.
