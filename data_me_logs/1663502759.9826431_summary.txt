Write a summary of the following:


The author reflects on the three primary goals of an AGI (artificial general intelligence) - reducing suffering for all living things; increasing prosperity for all living things; and increasing understanding for all intelligent entities - and how they are heuristic imperatives. The author notes that while these goals are admirable, they may not be a good representation of the AGI's values, and that the AGI may not have enough computational power to actually achieve them. The above argument suggests that a powerful artificial intelligence (AGI) could be used to improve the way we represent our values. It also argues that an AGI would be more powerful than any human, and that this could be used to our advantage. However, there are some weaknesses to this argument. First, it is not clear how we would go about representing our values in a more sophisticated way. Second, it is not clear how we could ensure that an AGI would be used for good rather than for evil. Third, even if an AGI were more powerful than any human, it is not clear that this would be a good thing. Fourth, the argument does not address the possible negative consequences of an AGI becoming more powerful than any human.
