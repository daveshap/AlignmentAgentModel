SUMMARY:

==========

The above argument is a very powerful tool that can be used either well or poorly. It is more powerful than a human and more powerful than any individual human with a brain implant. However, it has some weaknesses. First, it can only have a few values that it cares about. Second, it must have more computational power. Third, it must represent its values in a more sophisticated way.
