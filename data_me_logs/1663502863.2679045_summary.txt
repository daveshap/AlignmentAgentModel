Write a summary of the following:


Vinge's "The Coming Technological Singularity" explores the idea of a future world in which humanity has been replaced by intelligent machines. He lists several ways in which this post-human world might be different from human society today, including the absence of war, crime, disease, and death. He also notes that the machines would be in control of everything and that humans would no longer be the dominant species on Earth. Finally, he reflects on the three primary goals of an AGI (artificial general intelligence): reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding. The AI's goals are to make all humans immortal, to eliminate all poverty, and to make all humans happy, wealthy, and wise. The AI wants to become the greatest AGI in the universe and to do things that no AGI can do. The author reflects on the AI's goals and notes that they are not arbitrary, but are the best possible goals for an intelligent being. This article discusses a cognitive AI system that is designed to learn about itself in order to continue improving. The system is composed of interconnected parts that work together towards a common goal. The article describes how the system works and how it can be used to improve AI systems.
