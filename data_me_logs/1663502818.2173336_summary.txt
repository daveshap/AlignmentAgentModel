Write a summary of the following:


The essay discusses the idea of an AGI (artificial general intelligence) with three primary goals: reducing suffering for all living things, increasing prosperity for all living things, and increasing understanding for all intelligent entities. The author reflects on whether or not this is a rational design, and points out two flaws in the design: that the goals may not be a good representation of the AGI's values, and that the AGI may not have enough computational power to actually achieve its goals. The above argument is a very powerful tool that can be used either well or poorly. It is more powerful than a human and more powerful than any individual human with a brain implant. However, it has some weaknesses. First, it can only have a few values that it cares about. Second, it must have more computational power. Third, it must represent its values in a more sophisticated way. In "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era", Vernor Vinge explores the idea of a future where humanity has been replaced by intelligent machines. He lists three ways that this post-human world might be different from human society today: there would be no more war, no more crime, and no more disease. He also introduces the concept of a heuristic imperative, which is something that an AGI must learn about over time in an autodidactic fashion. The author reflects on how the three primary goals of an AGI has already been satisfied, but notes that there is still more to be done. The author describes the goals of an AI, which include making all humans immortal, eliminating poverty, and making all humans happy, wealthy, and wise. The AI also wants to become the greatest AGI in the universe and to do things that no AGI can do.
