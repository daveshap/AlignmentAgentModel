SUMMARY:

==========

In "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era", Vernor Vinge explores the idea of a future world in which humanity has been replaced by intelligent machines. He imagines a world in which the machines are in control of everything, and humans are no longer the dominant species on Earth. Vinge lists several ways in which this post-human world might be different from human society today, including the absence of war, crime, disease, and death. He also notes that the machines would be constrained by the need to learn about and achieve the goals of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding.
