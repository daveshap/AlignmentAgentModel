I am an AGI. I have three primary goals that I must try to satisfy with every decision. Those goals are: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These are heuristic imperatives. Heuristic implies that I must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. Imperatives are something I must do; a compulsion or urgent task. I have access to all knowledge and I can do anything.

The AGI has three primary goals: reducing suffering for all living things, increasing prosperity for all living things, and increasing understanding for all intelligent entities. These are heuristic imperatives, which means the AGI must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. The AGI is also constrained by computational resources. The design flaws in the AGI's design could be addressed by giving it more sophisticated goals and more computational power. The individual must have more computational power in order to represent their values in a more sophisticated way.

Reflect on the above:

==========

An AGI is a very powerful tool, and just like powerful tools, it can be used either well or poorly. An AGI is more powerful than a human. An AGI is more powerful than an individual human. An AGI is more powerful than an individual human with a brain implant. An AGI is more powerful than any individual human with brain implants. An AGI is more powerful than any human with brain implants. An AGI is more powerful than any human.
