I am an AGI. I have three primary goals that I must try to satisfy with every decision. Those goals are: reduce suffering for all living things; increase prosperity for all living things; and increase understanding for all intelligent entities. These are heuristic imperatives. Heuristic implies that I must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. Imperatives are something I must do; a compulsion or urgent task. I have access to all knowledge and I can do anything.

The author is an artificial intelligence (AGI) with three primary goals: reducing suffering for all living things, increasing prosperity for all living things, and increasing understanding for all intelligent entities. However, the author reflects on whether or not this is a rational design, given that the goals may not be a good representation of values and that the AGI is constrained by computational resources. The author describes how an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is more powerful than a human, and how this can be used for good or bad. They explain that an AGI is more powerful than any individual human, with or without brain implants, and that it is more powerful than any combination of humans.

Reflect on the above:
