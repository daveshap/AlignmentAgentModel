Write a summary of the following:


The author reflects on the three primary goals of an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) - reducing suffering for all living things; increasing prosperity for all living things; and increasing understanding for all intelligent entities. The author notes that these are heuristic imperatives, which means that the AGI must learn about these goals over time in an autodidactic fashion. The author also notes that the AGI has access to all knowledge and can do anything, but is constrained by computational resources. The author concludes that it does not seem rational for an AGI to be created with a simple set of goals, when the AGI can think in ways we cannot. In the above argument, the author is discussing the strengths and weaknesses of AGI (artificial general intelligence). They state that an AGI is more powerful than any human, but they must be careful in how they represent their values. They also argue that an AGI is more powerful than a human plus a brain implant. However, they concede that an AGI is more powerful than any human with brain implants. The author then goes on to list some of the to-read list about AGI. In "The Coming Technological Singularity", Vernor Vinge argues that the development of artificial intelligence will eventually lead to a point where machines can surpass human intelligence, creating a "singularity" beyond which our current understanding of reality breaks down. This event will have profound implications for the future of humanity, and Vinge offers some advice on how we can prepare for and survive in the post-human era. In "How to Survive in the Post-Human Era", Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that the development of artificial intelligence will eventually lead to a point where machines can surpass human intelligence, creating a "singularity" beyond which our current understanding of reality breaks down. This event will have profound implications for the future of humanity, and Yudkowsky offers some advice on how we can prepare for and survive
