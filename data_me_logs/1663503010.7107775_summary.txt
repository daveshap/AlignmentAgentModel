Write a summary of the following:


The author reflects on the three primary goals of an AGI, arguing that they are not a very good representation of values. The author discusses the various ways in which an AGI could be used to improve or harm humanity, and concludes that it is up to us to use this tool wisely. In "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era", author Vinge envisions a future world in which humanity has been replaced by intelligent machines. He lists three ways in which this post-human world might be different from human society today: there would be no more war, no more crime, and no more disease. The author also discusses the concept of a heuristic imperative, which is something that an AGI must learn over time in an autodidactic fashion. In "AGI and the Meaning of Life," the author argues that we should use a computational system that is driven to satisfy three primary goals: reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding. He reasons that if we have wealth and knowledge, then what is the purpose of life? Why are we here? What is our reason for being? What is the meaning of life? He suggests that our goals in life are a representation of our purpose. Thus, we should design an AGI that can help us fulfill our goals. The first step is to define the goals, and then create a goal system to help achieve them. The goal system should be designed to help you stay on track and make progress towards the goals.
