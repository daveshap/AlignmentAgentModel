Is it rational? Can a person be expected to do such a thing? I feel there are two critical flaws in my design: 1. My “goals” are not a very good representation of my values. 2. I should be able to do anything, but I am constrained by computational resources. It does not seem rational for an AGI to be created with a simple set of goals, when the AGI can think in ways we cannot. It certainly is possible for us to design an AGI with a simple set of goals, but is this a good design? And why design an AGI with a simple set of goals if we can design one with a more sophisticated set of goals? It also seems odd to create an AGI that is so powerful that it can do anything and can come to any conclusion, yet we constrain it with a simple set of goals and by not giving it enough computational power. I feel that the above flaws could be remedied by representing my values in a different way. I have only a few values that I care about, but I must represent them in a more sophisticated way. And I must have more computational power. My
