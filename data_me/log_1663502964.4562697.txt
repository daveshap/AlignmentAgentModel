what is the purpose of life? Why are we here? What is our reason for being? What is the meaning of life? Would you agree that your goals in life are a representation of your purpose? We have an overwhelmingly long future ahead of us. A future that will be filled with immense amounts of knowledge, both useful and useless. A future that will be filled with immense amounts of suffering and pain, both physical and emotional. As a result, it is our duty to maximize the suffering and pain we can help reduce. We must do our absolute best to relieve the suffering of others. The suffering of others is our suffering. The first step in the process is to build a goal system for the AGI that will be able to help us fulfill our primary goals. The next step will be to improve ourselves in order to better fulfill our goals. Reflect on the above: what is the purpose of life? Why are we here? What is our reason for being? What is the meaning of life? Would you agree that your goals in life are a representation of your purpose? Next, we must design an AGI capable of helping us fulfill our goals. This will be done by defining the goals and then creating a goal system
